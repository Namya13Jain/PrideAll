# Problem Statement
The LGBTQ+ community is the most vulnerable and underrepresented community in India. They are excluded from society and not given access to many facilities, rights and respect. So, it is important to educate and help the community in a wholesome manner by providing them with the help, resources, support and respect they deserve.

# PrideAll - One for All, All for One

# Future Scope
1. In the community forums, I have thought of adding a post section where the users can post blogs, write inspirational stories and discuss various issues, instead of mailing as it is done now.
2. Lawyers can be onboarded on our platform to provide legal help to the community people who need them. It would be a win-win for both parties as the lawyers will get clients and our users will get a legal advisor to stand by their side.
3. I have thought of collaborating with government organizations and NGOs to increase the reach of the PrideAll platform and connect relevant connections and organizations to open the doors to more communities.
